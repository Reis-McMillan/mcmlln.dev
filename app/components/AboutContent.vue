      As a Data Science, Statistics, and Mathematics student at Purdue University,
      I engineer high-performance, data-driven applications at the intersection of
      rigorous theory and scalable infrastructure. My technical interests center on
      deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian methods, with a
      professional focus on AI/ML engineering.

      Currently, I am a Founding Engineer at Concrete Engine, where I lead a
      team building the future of high-performance computing by designing
      robust observability and data-handling systems.
